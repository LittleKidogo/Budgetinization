# MoneyLog Backend

This is the Elixir backend API for `MoneyLog`
MoneyLog is an application that helps us spend our money on stuff we want!
Through intensive research after trying to use various 'budget' applications with Carla we came to
develop a number of spreadsheets and some formulas that gave us much needed confidence in our
spending. This group of spreadsheets and formulas are now being translated into an application with
 some automation to aid us.
